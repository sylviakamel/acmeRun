=== (S.4) Detailed usage scenarios

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Examples of interaction between the environment (or human users) and the system, expressed as user stories. Such scenarios are not by themselves a substitute for precise descriptions of functionality (<<s3>>), but provide an important complement by specifying cases that these behavior descriptions must support; they also serve as a basis for developing test cases. The scenarios most relevant for stakeholders are given in chapter <<g5>> in the Goals book, at a general level, as use cases; in contrast, <<s4>> can refer to system components and functionality (from other chapters of the System book) as well as special and erroneous cases, and introduce more specific scenarios._  <<BM22>>

==== (S.4.1) Running with the Application
*Use Case:* <<uc1>> +
*Primary Actor:* App user  +
*Precondition:*  User has internet access and the app downloaded. +
*Trigger:* User wants to go for a run near or on campus. +
*Main Success Scenario:*

*Success Postcondition:*  User has completed an outdoor workout near or on campus. +
This scenario is important as it demonstrates the core purpose of the app â€“ providing affordable and accessible workout opportunities. We can expect some users to not own compatible heart rate monitors to aid in data collection, and some users may not even be registered on the app yet.
